Gesture state machine mockup

			idle		yawn		scan		think		Blink
idle		.80			.84			0.8			0.8 		0.3
yawn		.01			0.01		0.05		0.1			0.2
scan		.06			0.1			0.06 		.05			0.1
think		.03			0.05		0.05		.0 			0.1
blink		0.1			0.1			0.1			.05  		0.3


pros:	clean, easy to implement FSM
cons:	each emotion requires a different state machines for optimum realism
		harders to design/config



Metric based emotional behavior: Each emotional state defines these metrics, seprate controllers uses these values accordingly:

Blink Frequency: 1.0
Blink Speed: 2.0
Breathing Frequency: 2.0
Breathing Intensity: 2.0
Swiftness:
Shyness:


controllers:
	blink
	breathing
	gestures
	emotions
	tracking


Emotional values:
All values taper to neutral, except bored. Which increases when no other actions are played.
